# AI-Driven 3D Iteration Engine

Goal: Create a self-optimizing design loop where open-source AI tools, Hunyuan3D, and parametric modeling collaborate iteratively. Users can intervene at fixation grid points or let the system auto-revise until convergence.
Core Loop Architecture

![Flow: Pixel (AI Sketch) → 3D/Vector → Pixel (Rendered Feedback)]
Key Innovation: A dual-path workflow ensures GPU-heavy 3D generation (Hunyuan3D) and CPU-light vector tracing (SVG/OpenSCAD) run in parallel, merging only for final validation. Fixation grids anchor geometric relationships between iterations, avoiding drift.
1. Iteration Cycle Overview

# Step 1: Open-Source AI Graphics Engine (Stable Diffusion)

    Input: User prompt (e.g., "modern house with glass facade").

    Output: 2D sketch (PNG) + fixation grid (metadata for alignment).

    Grid Rules: Critical features (e.g., window corners, roof apex) snap to grid lines for cross-format consistency.

## Step 2: Dual-Path Processing

    Path A (GPU-Heavy):

        Hunyuan3D-Paint: Convert sketch to textured 3D mesh.

        Blender Post-Process: Simplify geometry, apply grid anchors.

    Path B (CPU-Efficient):

        SVG Tracing: Python script (OpenCV + Potrace) converts sketch to vector.

        OpenSCAD Parametrization: Auto-generate code with grid-aligned variables.

## Step 3: Blender Fusion & Feedback

    Merge Paths: Overlay Hunyuan3D mesh with OpenSCAD vector outlines in Blender.

    Render New "Photo": Cycles engine generates a photorealistic image, preserving the fixation grid.

    Loop Closure: Feed rendered image + grid back to Stable Diffusion for revision:
    python
    Copy

    def revise_design(image, grid):  
        revised_sketch = stable_diffusion.run(  
            prompt="Improve realism, keep grid aligned",  
            init_image=image,  
            grid_constraints=grid  
        )  
        return revised_sketch  

# 2. Fixation Grid: The Iteration Anchor

    Purpose: Maintain spatial relationships across AI ↔ 3D ↔ Vector ↔ Pixel transitions.

    Implementation:

        Grid as JSON: Stores coordinates of critical points (e.g., {"window_corner": [x,y,z]}).

        Cross-Tool Sync:

            Hunyuan3D meshes snap vertices to grid keys.

            OpenSCAD asserts alignment: assert(grid["door_height"] == 2.1, "Door violates grid");

            Stable Diffusion uses grid as a ControlNet-like conditioning layer.

# 3. User Intervention Points

A. Direct Modeling: Export Hunyuan3D/OpenSCAD outputs to Blender for manual tweaking.
B. Grid Editing: Adjust fixation grid parameters (e.g., stretch X-axis spacing) to steer AI revisions.
C. Loop Exit: Export manufacturing-ready files (STEP from OpenSCAD, STL from Hunyuan3D).
4. Benefits of the Hybrid Loop

    Speed: Hunyuan3D drafts concepts in minutes; SVG/OpenSCAD refines details offline.

    Precision: Fixation grids prevent "AI drift" across iterations.

    Flexibility: Users toggle between fully automated loops and hands-on CAD work.

### Next: We’ll explore  scripting tactics to sync Hunyuan3D’s mesh outputs with OpenSCAD’s parametric grid system.

# Hunyuan3D-to-OpenSCAD Slicing Workflow

Objective: Use OpenSCAD to extract 2D plans/sections from Hunyuan3D’s 3D meshes, then refine them via AI sketching while preserving parametric relationships.
1. Slicing Hunyuan3D Models in OpenSCAD
Step 1: Import and Slice
openscad
Copy

// Import Hunyuan3D mesh (e.g., a building concept)  
import("hunyuan_building.stl");  

// Slice at Z-height to extract floor plan  
module floor_plan(z_height) {  
  projection(cut = true)  
  translate([0, 0, z_height])  
    import("hunyuan_building.stl");  
}  

// Generate 1st floor plan (Z=3m)  
floor_plan(3000);  

    Output: 2D floor plan (SVG/DXF) for AI sketching.

Step 2: Parametric Facade Extraction
openscad
Copy

// Extract facade outline from Hunyuan3D mesh  
module facade_slice(angle=90) {  
  rotate([0, angle, 0])  
  projection(cut=true)  
    import("hunyuan_building.stl");  
}  
facade_slice(90); // Front view  

    Use Case: Export facades as SVG for AI redlining (e.g., adding windows/balconies).

2. AI Sketching on Slices
Step 3: Stable Diffusion + ControlNet Enhancement

    Python Script: Feed OpenSCAD slices to AI for stylistic iteration:
    python
    Copy

    from diffusers import StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline  
    import cv2  

    # Convert OpenSCAD SVG slice to PNG  
    slice_png = convert_svg_to_png("floor_plan.svg")  

    # Generate AI-enhanced sketch (e.g., "Art Deco facade")  
    pipe = StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline.from_pretrained("runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5")  
    enhanced_sketch = pipe(  
      prompt="modern facade with floor-to-ceiling windows",  
      controlnet_conditioning_image=slice_png,  
    ).images[0]  

    Key: ControlNet ensures AI respects the OpenSCAD slice structure.

Step 4: Vectorize AI Outputs
python
Copy

# Trace AI sketch back to SVG  
from potrace import Bitmap  

bitmap = Bitmap(enhanced_sketch)  
paths = bitmap.trace()  
paths.save("enhanced_facade.svg")  

3. Re-Import into OpenSCAD
Step 5: Parametric Hybrid Design
openscad
Copy

// Combine original Hunyuan3D mesh with AI-enhanced facade  
difference() {  
  import("hunyuan_building.stl");  
  translate([0, 0, 3000])  
  linear_extrude(1000)  
    import("enhanced_facade.svg"); // Cut AI-designed windows  
}  

// Add AI-generated balcony (extruded SVG)  
translate([0, 5000, 3000])  
linear_extrude(500)  
  import("ai_balcony.svg");  

4. Closed-Loop Iteration

![Loop: OpenSCAD Slice → AI Sketch → Revised 3D Model]

    Slice: Extract 2D plans/sections from Hunyuan3D.

    Sketch: AI stylizes/redlines SVGs.

    Rebuild: OpenSCAD integrates AI edits into 3D model.

    Render: Blender generates photorealistic views.

    Repeat: Feed renders back to AI for further refinement.

Fixation Grid Integration

    OpenSCAD Grid Anchor:
    openscad
    Copy

    // Define grid points for AI alignment  
    grid = [  
      [0, 0, 3000],  // Floor 1 origin  
      [5000, 0, 3000] // Floor 1 corner  
    ];  

    // Assert AI edits align with grid  
    assert(window_x >= grid[0][0] && window_x <= grid[1][0], "Window out of grid");  

    AI Conditioning: Stable Diffusion uses grid coordinates as a ControlNet layer to preserve scale.

Benefits

    Parametric + Generative: Retain Hunyuan3D’s speed for concepts, OpenSCAD’s precision for fabrication.

    Style Flexibility: AI iterates on facades/floor plans without rebuilding 3D models from scratch.

    Resource Efficiency: GPU-heavy AI runs only on 2D slices, not full 3D geometry.

Example Workflow

    Hunyuan3D: Generate a low-detail building concept.

    OpenSCAD: Slice at Z=3m → export floor_plan.svg.

    Stable Diffusion: Transform floor_plan.svg into "open-plan layout with curved walls".

    OpenSCAD: Cut new AI-designed layout into original mesh.

    Blender: Render revised design → feed to AI for material suggestions.
